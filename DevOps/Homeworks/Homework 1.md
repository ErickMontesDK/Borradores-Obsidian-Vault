> [!abstract] **5-What is Software Architecture and how its related to Enterprise Architecture?**
> <ul> 
> <li>Software Architecture is the components that are part of the software, but also how each part works and interacts with the other components and the way they are arranged. It helps to understand and analyze the system structure and behavior.</li>
> <li>Similar to software architecture, Enterprise Architecture works with the structure and behavior of an organization. It coordinates the departmental processes across an organization. Both create strategies for parts of the process to achieve the same goal and bring a different perspective from the same situation.</li>
