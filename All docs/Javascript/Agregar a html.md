# Agregar a html
<hr> 

> [!abstract]
> In order to make JavaScript more modular, clean, and maintainable; ES6 introduced a way to easily share code among JavaScript files. This involves exporting parts of a file for use in one or more other files, and importing the parts you need, where you need them. In order to take advantage of this functionality, you need to create a script in your HTML document with a `type` of `module`. Here’s an example:
> 
> > [!example]
> > 
> > ```html
> > <script type="module" src="filename.js"></script>
> > ```
