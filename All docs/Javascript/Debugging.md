> Debugging is the process of going through your code, finding any issues, and fixing them.
> 
> Issues in code generally come in three forms: 
> * syntax errors that prevent your program from running
> * runtime errors where your code has unexpected behavior
> * logical errors where your code doesn't do what you intended.
