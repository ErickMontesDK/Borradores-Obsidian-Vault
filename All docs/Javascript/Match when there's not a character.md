# Match when there's not a character ^
<hr> 

> [!danger] ## Match when there's not a character ^
> You could also create a set of characters that you do not want to match. These types of character sets are calledÂ negated character sets.
> 
> To create a negated character set, you place a caret character (`^`) after the opening bracket and before the characters you do not want to match.
> 
> > [!example]
> > 
> > ```js
> > let quoteSample = "3 blind mice.";
> > let myRegex = /[^aeiou0123456789]/gi;
> > let result = quoteSample.match(myRegex);
> > ```
